# Listing Some Ideas & The Concept Of Change:
![Brainstorm](ChangeIdeas1.png)
I’ve been reflecting on some big life changes that really shifted how I see things, and I’ve turned them into game concepts. First, there’s the experience of COVID lockdown—where isolation made familiar places feel distant, lonely, and almost ghostly. Then, moving abroad for school, stepping out of my comfort zone into a foggy, unknown place, facing challenges and finding my way through unfamiliar territory. And finally, returning to school post-lockdown, where everything felt familiar yet somehow different. Each concept captures how these moments redefined my perspective, exploring themes of isolation, adaptation, and rediscovery in a way that feels personal.

# Eleminating Ideas & Finalizing Them:

This is the chosen topic that I’ve decided to go with, and I’m stoked to share how I’ll bring it to life! Players begin in The House as a Prison, a gloomy, cluttered room filled with the heavy atmosphere of quarantine. Bars on windows and locked doors echo the isolation, as players touch items that bring back memories of confinement. Then, it’s off to The Maze, symbolizing the anxiety and struggle of re-engaging with the world. Twisting paths and faint echoes amp up the tension, but a soft glow keeps them moving forward. Finally, they emerge into a Fantasy World, a vibrant wonderland where familiar sights become magical. Here, they’ll explore, reconnect, and find joy in the small things once more.
