# Unexpected Challenge Along The Path:

As I started developing my initial concept, I quickly realized that the ideas I wanted to bring to life were a lot more ambitious than I’d anticipated. 🌱🌄 My goal was to create an immersive environment, filled with lush trees, intricate props, and subtle details that would make the world feel alive. However, due to time constraints ⏳ and the sheer complexity of the project, it became clear that my vision was better on paper than in practice. Time management became a real challenge, and I found myself struggling to execute the concept as I had originally imagined it.

So, I decided to adapt and shift my focus to a new idea that was more achievable within the project’s scope. 🔄 I reimagined the game to center around the theme of change, symbolized by two distinct islands divided by a ravine and connected by a broken bridge. 🌉 This new concept allowed me to convey the emotional journey of leaving the familiar for the unknown. On one side lies a comforting medieval village, filled with warmth and familiarity. 🏰🍂 Crossing the bridge, however, takes players to a dark, foggy island—a place that’s eerie, unfamiliar, and unsettling, capturing the essence of stepping into the unknown. 🌫️🌌

# Rough Top-Map Sketches:

I started with a rough top-down draft of the map 🗺️ to ensure I could capture every essence I wanted for this project and stay true to my vision when bringing it to life in Unity. This map view helped me visualize how large the world should feel and guided the layout—how divided each area would be and where elements should be placed. 🌄 By mapping it out, I had a clear plan for positioning important features, allowing me to focus on creating a cohesive and immersive environment while keeping track of every detail along the way. 🌳🏘️

# Experimentation With Particle Effects:

Next, I jumped into creating a prototype of the map and main terrain. During this stage, I faced the challenge of dividing the terrain into two distinct areas—one that captures a bright, cheerful vibe with sunshine and rainbows ☀️🌈, and another that feels dark and mysterious 🌑🌫️. To achieve this contrast, I experimented with particle effects to enhance the atmosphere of each section. However, I’m still unsure and not fully convinced if it truly captures the essence I’m aiming for. This stage has been a lot of trial and error, but I’m excited to keep pushing forward!
