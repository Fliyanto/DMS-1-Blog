# Contrasting 2 Different Scenes:
![light](Unity6.png)
After finalizing the concept and fully understanding what needed to be done to bring it to life, I decided to create two separate scenes: one that embodies comfort and another that captures mystery. 🏡🌌 Using a bit of coding, I set up a trigger that seamlessly transitions from the cozy, familiar scene to the eerie unknown when crossing the bridge. 🌉 For the first scene, I focused on crafting a homey, warm atmosphere filled with sunshine and familiar elements that feel inviting. ☀️🏰 This transition really sets the tone, allowing players to experience the shift from comfort to the unknown.


# Progressing Further Into A New Scene:

"Next up was creating the second scene, which I aimed to make the complete opposite of the first. 🌀 Here, everything is intentionally out of place, scattered around, and much emptier, with thick fog surrounding it all. 🌫️ This disorganized layout captures the feeling of moving abroad—there’s a hint of familiarity, but everything feels off, like it hasn’t settled yet. You’re new to the place, and nothing quite feels right. To enhance this unsettling vibe, I also started exploring audio options to support the atmosphere in each scene, adding layers of sound that really draw you into the experience. 🎶🔊"

Welcome to Beyond The Familiar, a Unity-based game that explores the shift from comfort to the unknown. Your journey begins in a cozy medieval village, a symbol of family and warmth, complete with a long table surrounded by empty seats that capture the closeness of loved ones. As you move forward, the scene transforms, plunging you into an eerie, mysterious world—oddly familiar yet unsettling. This atmosphere mirrors my own experience of studying abroad, where familiarity mingles with the unknown, embodying the strange yet thrilling confusion of navigating a new place. Join me in this journey of change, discovery, and self-exploration!
