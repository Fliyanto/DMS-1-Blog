# Approaching To Wire Framing
So, after getting the hang of the whole column concept, we dove into another cool exercise in class. This time? We had to pick a website we know and try to recreate it from memory—yep, no peeking! 👀 Honestly, this was super fun for me because, well, I’m kinda competitive with myself 😅. It was like a personal challenge: Do I really know this site I visit all the time? Or am I just zoning in on what I want and totally ignoring the rest of the layout? 🤔

This activity felt like a reality check! It was an eye-opener into how every little detail on a website has its place and purpose. Suddenly, I wasn’t just clicking through; I was paying attention to every little section, like I’d unlocked a new way of seeing websites 🕵️‍♂️. I’ll dive more into this below—stay tuned! 👇

## Wireframing Example - Amazon.com

So, here’s the website I went with for this exercise: the one and only Amazon 🛒. We’d already broken it down before, so I figured, why not stick with it? This exercise was crazy interesting because it made me think like an audience member—someone who just uses the site, no big deal, right? But here’s the thing: it hit me just how important it is for a website to be memorable and easy to navigate 🔍. Like, as a typical Amazon shopper, I’m usually laser-focused on finding the stuff I want, not really on the layout or design. I’m all about that product!

But after this exercise? I realised I actually remember way more about the layout than I thought! 🤯 It’s like, oh wow—I do know where everything is because it’s set up in a way that sticks. This little realisation planted a new idea in my head: a website’s layout has to be designed just right, so people can remember it and breeze through without second thoughts. By the end of this project, I was set on making my own site as clean and intuitive as possible—no fancy gimmicks, just all the essentials lined up so anyone can navigate it easily. Because honestly, no one should have to struggle with what to click or where to go! 🖱️

# Wireframe Draft & Design Dilema 
Alright, so here’s where things got real. After all the practice and finally getting a grip on wireframing, I hit a major roadblock. 🚧 Like, a full-on “where do I even start?” kind of dilemma. It was one of the biggest challenges I faced—imagine staring at a blank screen, hitting a brick wall, and just not knowing how to take the next step. 😖 I needed to create a wireframe draft, a design... but where do I even begin?

I was honestly stumped. What should a website even include? How do I make it look interesting? I tried everything—Pinterest, Instagram, Google, you name it—but I was still circling in confusion, like, “What’s my first move here?” 🤷‍♂️ But then, a little lightbulb moment! 💡 Instead of stressing over how to start, I decided to learn the basics first: what should go on a website, what grabs attention, and how to avoid making it look like a snoozefest 😴.

So, I did some mini research on my own, just figuring out what makes a website pop and look interesting. Once I understood these core elements, I finally felt ready to jump into drafting. 🎨 From there, I had a foundation, and I could finally start shaping a site that wouldn’t just look good but would keep people’s eyes glued to it! 👀

So, once I got past the “where do I start?” dilemma, I came up with a game plan: dive deep into what grabs people’s attention on a website. 📊 I wanted to figure out what draws people in and what elements make them feel the website experience (in this case, AllML). Through my research, I stumbled upon a fascinating stat: about 70% of people look at the top left corner first when they land on a site. 🤯 Mind-blowing, right?

Naturally, I had to see this in action, so I checked out a bunch of my go-to websites. And sure enough, most had their logo or name smack in the top left. It’s the first thing people see—it’s like saying, “Hey, this is who we are!” 🖼️ So, taking a cue from that, I decided to pop a little nickname I usually go by in the top left of my draft. I figured it’d spark a bit of curiosity, like, “What does that mean?” 💭 And with that, I was finally rolling with my wireframe draft!

I started setting up sections with columns and rows, colour-coding them to keep everything organised. 🎨 The columns helped me structure images, text, and navigation so everything had its own space. And the rows? Those handy blue lines kept the spacing neat between text and other elements—no crowding, no squishing, just smooth flow! 🧊

This whole drafting process was a wake-up call: making a website is way more than just throwing content on a page. The layout, the wireframe, the spacing—it all matters. If a site feels too cramped, it’s a total turn-off. Writings get squished, images get blurry, and everything just feels chaotic. 😵 So, by the end of this draft, I had to ask myself—am I actually happy with this? Or should I start fresh? It was all about finding that perfect balance between functional and fabulous! 💪
