# Approaching To Wire Framing
So, after getting the hang of the whole column concept, we dove into another cool exercise in class. This time? We had to pick a website we know and try to recreate it from memory—yep, no peeking! 👀 Honestly, this was super fun for me because, well, I’m kinda competitive with myself 😅. It was like a personal challenge: Do I really know this site I visit all the time? Or am I just zoning in on what I want and totally ignoring the rest of the layout? 🤔

This activity felt like a reality check! It was an eye-opener into how every little detail on a website has its place and purpose. Suddenly, I wasn’t just clicking through; I was paying attention to every little section, like I’d unlocked a new way of seeing websites 🕵️‍♂️. I’ll dive more into this below—stay tuned! 👇
