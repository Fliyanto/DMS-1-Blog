# Changes & Implementations

Alright, so here we are—my two final website drafts! 🎉 One for desktop and one for mobile, both built on the same concept and elements. As I mentioned before, I wanted a simple, homey vibe, something that feels warm and welcoming. To get that “homey” feel, I threw in some personal touches that just scream comfort to me. One of my favourite details? The splashes of paint in the website title, with a bitmoji of yours truly (complete with devil wings!) spraying pink paint on one of the letters. 🎨 It’s quirky, it’s fun, and there’s a hidden meaning behind it!

Now, don’t get the devil wings wrong—it doesn’t mean I’m some evil mastermind or a supervillain. 😈 To me, those wings represent a little bit of mischief, a hint of the “playful rebel” side I think we all have. I like to think of it as my inner child peeking out, reminding me to keep my creativity as wild as it was when I was 5. 👶 Even as an adult, I still feel that urge to let my imagination run wild—sometimes, that means spending on things that others might find a bit… unnecessary. But hey, it keeps the inner child happy, so why not? 😅

Another touch I added to bring out the cosy, crafty side is a nod to something I always wanted as a kid: a homemade mood board! I always dreamed of having a softboard pinned up with photos, notes, tasks—just a whole wall of creativity. 🖼️ Since that never happened in real life, I decided to bring it to life on my website. Instead of just placing images neatly, I made it look like they’re taped up, almost like an actual mood board! Some photos are tilted, some have extra tape, and there’s this casual, thrown-together vibe that feels, well, like home. 🏡

Even though a portfolio usually has a more formal vibe, I wanted to keep it fun and inviting. I’m making it a bit more conversational by including questions here and there, so readers feel like they’re part of the journey. ✨ I hope this style draws people in, keeps them engaged, and makes them feel right at home while browsing through my work.

# Short Look Back
So, here’s my final takeaway from this project: it really highlighted just how indecisive I can be! 😅 There were so many moments when I had this clear vision of the message or vibe I wanted to create, but then… the execution? Yeah, not quite what I imagined. It was a bit frustrating at times, but this indecisiveness actually became a strength—I learned to step back, review, and re-approach everything from a fresh perspective. 🔄

And another thing? I realised that the formal route just isn’t for me. When I work on projects, I want to create an environment that’s comfortable and inviting, where everyone feels connected. 🧩 So, for this project, I went with a more casual tone, and it really made me feel like I was connecting with my audience on a personal level, like they’re a part of this journey with me. 🙌

This whole project has honestly been such a blast! 🎢 My mentor’s guidance helped me reflect and grow with every step, and even the challenges ended up leading me to something better in the end. It reminds me of one of my favourite quotes: “Life is like a staircase. Taking one step back isn’t a setback—it’s just gearing you up to move forward by two.” 🪜

Overall, this project taught me the importance of timing and pacing. Don’t cram everything at once, but don’t drag things out too long, either. Find that sweet spot, and you’ll make real progress. And if you need to step back, it’s not a loss; it’s just a chance to catch your breath, reflect, and move forward stronger. 💪 Every step—forward or back—gets you closer to where you want to be! 🌟
