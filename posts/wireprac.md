# Columns Practice & Wonders
Alright, so picture this: before jumping into this project, I actually tried something similar back in the day—a little website project for school. But let me tell you, the way I went about it then is night and day compared to my approach now. 🌅 In this new adventure, I discovered something game-changing: the mysterious world of the 12 columns 🕵️‍♂️. Yep, the “behind-the-scenes” guide that gives websites their clean, sleek look. Who knew? 🤯

These columns—typically 12 but sometimes fewer—stretch across the page, like the skeleton that tells you exactly where stuff goes. It’s all about making the layout super organised 🧑‍💻 so your eyes just flow from one section to the next. And guess what? I had no idea this was even a thing! The more I dug into it, the more I realised almost every site out there uses columns to arrange images, text, and everything else in a way that just makes sense. Mind-blowing, right? 💥 Like, what else have I been missing?

So, with this new insight, I didn’t just dive straight into drafting; I went all out and created two layers instead of one—one layer for columns and another for rows. 🎨 It’s like a colour-coded map that shows exactly where everything should land. And honestly? It’s a total game-changer 🚀. This little structure trick really makes a difference, and I feel like more people should be hyped about it. 🙌 Trust me, once you see how much easier it makes organising a website, you’ll never look back! 👀

After diving into this concept, we jumped right into Figma, a design playground for creatives 🖌️. Our task? To pick an existing website, wander around it a bit, and try to decode how many columns it’s rocking and how they’re divvied up across each section. Let me tell you—it was surprisingly fun! 🎢 Almost like a little mystery game 🔍. You’re piecing things together without fully knowing what the final puzzle should look like, but that’s what makes it exciting!

So there I was, fumbling around at first 🤷‍♂️, trying to make sense of this grid thing, and then bam—it clicks! 💡 By diving straight into the deep end and figuring things out as I went, I got this awesome sense of organisation. By the end, I went from kind of guessing to being 100% confident in how columns work and why they’re basically a website’s best friend. 🤓 Now, columns aren’t just lines on a screen—they’re the secret sauce to making a website flow. 🍃
