# Self Portrait Video Draft #1 (Footage Concept Only)

First draft for this assignment, I decided to focus on experimenting with footage I have shoot specifically and trying to piece them all together to get a general idea and illustration of what I might like to include or what I might not include for the final product. This first draft is basically the strating point of the project to help kick start the flow of creative juices to work on the rest.

# Self Portrait Video Draft #2 (Footage + Audio Concept)

Second draft of this assignment focus on every aspect that I love and would like to portray in the final product, including audio and different kind of transitions and more to help further enhance the emoions that I would like to convey to the audience. During this stage I realised that its better for me to scrap the idea from the first draft and the concept of chaotic to a more fun an happy tone video.


# Self Portrait Video Final Draft

The final draft is taken directly from the second draft although some adjustments have been made and implemented adding any aditional footage to help the length of the video itself and to insert more to the video rounding it as a memorable experience that was enjoyed by myself and my friends in the process of making it.
